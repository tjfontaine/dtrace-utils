# This script tests that libproc can still track the state of the link map of a
# multithreaded process when it is continuously changing.  We turn LD_AUDIT off
# first to make sure that only one lmid is in use.
#
# The number of threads is arbitrary: it only matters that it is >1.

# @@timeout: 50

# @@xfail: almost guaranteed to fail due to loss of latching of process pre-libproc-mt
