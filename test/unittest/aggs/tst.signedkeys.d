 * ASSERTION:
 * 	Signed integer keys print and sort as expected.
 *
 * SECTION: Aggregations, Printing Aggregations
 *
 * NOTES: DTrace sorts integer keys as unsigned values, yet prints 32-
 * and 64-bit integers as signed values. Since the Java DTrace API is
 * expected to emulate this behavior, this test was added to ensure that
 * the behavior is preserved. Consistency with trace() output is also
 * tested.
