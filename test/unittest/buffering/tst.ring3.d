/*
 * We make some regrettable assumptions about the implementation in this test.
 * First, we assume that each entry for the printf() of an int takes _exactly_
 * eight bytes (four bytes for the EPID, four bytes for the payload).  Second,
 * we assume that by allocating storage for n + 1 records, we will get exactly
 * n.  Here is why:  the final predicate that evaluates to false will reserve
 * space that it won't use.  This act of reservation will advance the wrapped
 * offset.  That record won't be subsequently used, but the wrapped offset has
 * advanced.  (And in this case, that old record is clobbered by the exit()
 * anyway.)  Thirdly:  we rely on t_cpu/cpu_id.  Finally:  we rely on being
 * able to run on the CPU that we first ran on.
