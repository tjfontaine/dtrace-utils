# Test ip:::{send,receive} of IPv4 UDP to a local address.
#
# This may fail due to:
#
# 1. A change to the ip stack breaking expected probe behavior,
#    which is the reason we are testing.
# 2. No physical network interface is plumbed and up.
# 3. No other hosts on this subnet are reachable and listening on rpcbind.
# 4. An unlikely race causes the unlocked global send/receive
#    variables to be corrupted.
#
# This test sends a UDP message using ping and checks that at least the
# following counts were traced:
#
# 1 x ip:::send (UDP sent to ping's base UDP port)
# 1 x ip:::receive (UDP received)
# 

if (( $# != 1 )); then
	echo "expected one argument: <dtrace-path>" >&2
