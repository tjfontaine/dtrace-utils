# Test ip:::{send,receive} of IPv4 TCP to a remote host.
#
# This may fail due to:
#
# 1. A change to the ip stack breaking expected probe behavior,
#    which is the reason we are testing.
# 2. The loopback interface missing or not up.
# 3. The local ssh service is not online.
# 4. An unlikely race causes the unlocked global send/receive
#    variables to be corrupted.
#
# This test performs a TCP connection and checks that at least the
# following packet counts were traced:
#
# 3 x ip:::send (2 during the TCP handshake, then a FIN)
# 2 x ip:::receive (1 during the TCP handshake, then the FIN ACK)
#
# The network stack may elide at least one of these, so check for 4.
