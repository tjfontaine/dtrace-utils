 * ASSERTION:
 *   Declare a dynamic type and then use it to access the root path for the

 * SECTION: Structs and Unions/Structs;
 *	Variables/External Variables
 *
 * NOTES:
 *  This test program declares a dynamic type and then uses it to bcopy() the
 *  qstr representing the name of the root dentry for the current process.  We
 *  then use the dynamic type to access the result of our bcopy().  The
 *  special "D" module type scope is also tested.
