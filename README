Linux DTrace v0.3 for x86_64 Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 2.6.39
------------

This is the official Linux port of the advanced tracing tool DTrace.
It relies on a userspace component, a CDDLed kernel module, and a
few changes in the kernel.

The following components work, so far:

 - the entire D language, including lookup of kernel types, with a few
   limited exceptions (see INCOMPATIBILITIES).

 - the syscall provider (with the exception of the clone probe, which
   is disabled)

 - the profile provider (with the exception of arbitrary-precision
   profile timers).

 - kernel stack tracebacks, but ustack() prints addresses only, no symbols

Major components not yet present include all the other providers, including sdt
and usdt.
